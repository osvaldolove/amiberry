- New target platform: Pi 3
- Optimizations for Pi 3 added
- Pi 3 is now the default target if no Platform is specified
- Added support for custom functions assignable to keyboard LEDs (e.g. HD activity)
- Code formatting and cleanup
- FullHD (1080p) resolution supported in Picasso96 mode on all Pi models
